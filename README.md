# COMP9517-PROJECT

#### File Structure

```python
model_Resnet.py         # Core ResNet34 architecture (this file)
train.py                # Script for training the model
test.py                 # Script for evaluating the model
main.py                 # Entry point (e.g. training pipeline)
image_split.py          # Utility to split dataset into train/val
class_indices.json      # Mapping between class indices and labels
```

#### Features

* Custom ResNet class using BasicBlock


* Supports dynamic block depth and downsampling


* include_top toggle to remove the final classification layer for feature extraction


* Built-in support for 1000-class classification (can be changed)

#### How to use

1. **image_split**

   * Image_split is a Separate tool file, help you to split your own dataset.
   * If you have prepared data set then you do not need to use this.
   * If you need to use this tool, don't forget to update the data path and output location according to your own setup.

2. **Train the model**

   ```python
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Evaluate the model**

   ```python
   python test.py
   ```

4. **Use the pretrained weights(optional)**

   ```python
   model.load_state_dict(torch.load("resnet34-pre.pth"))
   #https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet34-333f7ec4.pth
   ```

#### **Reference**

This project was developed with reference to the following open-source implementations:

- [[WZMIAOMIAO/deep-learning-for-image-processing](https://github.com/WZMIAOMIAO/deep-learning-for-image-processing)](https://github.com/username/repo-name): Used as a reference for model architecture and training pipeline.
- [pytorch/vision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision): Official PyTorch models were used for comparison and weight loading.

#### **Notes**

* Tested on PyTorch â‰¥ 1.12, Python 3.8+
